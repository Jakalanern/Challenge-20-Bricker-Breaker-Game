# Challenge-20-Bricker-Breaker-Game
Really fun challenge! I followed a tutorial for this but made sure I understood how everything works. It was my first time using canvas and I learned a lot.

I implemented a lot of features myself without guidance such as the **pause system**, **pause screen**, **sounds**, **sound toggle system with button control**, **win/loss conditions**, **score counter**, **life counter**, **DARK / LIGHT themes with button control**, **game difficuly**, etc...

**Gameplay:**

Ball speeds up everytime you bounce it

You have 3 lives

If you lose a life, speed gets reset

Once you destroy all bricks you win!

**Features:**

Light / Dark Modes!

3 lives and a life counter

Brick counter to track how close you are to winning.

WASD / Arrow Key controls

Mouse control is in the code but commented out for now - prefer the key controls

Pause / Resume game pressing esc

**Controls:**

WASD or Keys to Move

ESC to pause

Click sun / moon icon to change theme

**UPDATE:**

Added game sounds!

Added a toggle ON/OFF for all game sounds

Added hearts for lives, background music, and win/loss screens

Added ability to restart after win or loss

Added mobile media queries to alert its desktop only
